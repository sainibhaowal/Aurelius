# Aurelius Implementation Record

## Purpose
This file is the durable record of what Aurelius is, what has been implemented, and what remains to be completed.
Use this as the source of truth for future engineering, product, and launch work.

## Current Product Position
Aurelius is a lean HR Intelligence platform that works end to end without vendor auth.
It supports local CSV import, bundled demo data loading, explainable attrition, interventions, compliance policy checks, sync history, drift snapshots, scenario runs, and tenant-scoped enterprise operations.

## What Is Implemented
1. Employee and candidate management.
2. Skill and experience capture.
3. Explainable attrition risk scoring.
4. Risk-driver drilldown and intervention creation.
5. Intervention lifecycle with 30/60/90 outcome checkpoints.
6. Connector registry with field mappings and sync history.
7. Scheduled sync orchestration.
8. Compliance policy packs and policy checks.
9. Attrition model registry, drift snapshots, and retraining trigger.
10. Workforce scenario persistence.
11. Tenant-aware request context and enterprise route scoping.
12. Local CSV import and demo bundle import.
13. Enterprise operations frontend controls.
14. Audit logging for enterprise actions.
15. Fairness summary reporting.
16. Model governance cards and release gates.
17. Dedicated public landing route outside the shell.
18. Direct dashboard-first workspace entry with no launch screen.
19. Lazy-loaded workspace views and deferred report/export bundle.
20. DR / SRE admin runbooks and procurement artifact management.
21. Full landing-page blueprint implementation with problem, solution, modules, demo, integrations, governance, and CTA sections.
22. Import validation scorecards and executive packet generation.
23. Floating page-scoped agent drawer with real action buttons and page-context copilot prompts.
24. OpenCode Zen provider added to provider settings and wired through chat/copilot/talent flows.
25. Client dev script now binds Vite to 127.0.0.1 so npm run dev serves consistently on the local loopback address.
26. Landing page hero was tightened further into a more literal black reference composition with animated geometry, featured-in logos, and a calmer Inter-based type scale.

## Operational Flow
1. Load demo bundle or upload CSV files.
2. Import employees, candidates, skills, and experience.
3. Run attrition model training.
4. Review risk drivers and create interventions.
5. Apply policy checks before high-impact actions.
6. Run workforce scenarios and store outcomes.
7. Monitor sync jobs, quarantine, and drift snapshots.

## Data Import Paths
1. Demo bundle import from `server/datasets/processed`.
2. CSV upload through the Enterprise Operations screen.
3. Connector sync framework for future vendor integrations.

## Remaining Optional Enterprise Gaps
1. Real Workday / Greenhouse / SuccessFactors auth and live APIs.
2. Stronger fairness and regional compliance packs.
3. Deep SRE and disaster recovery hardening.
4. External connector marketplace.

## Validation Status
1. Backend compile passes.
2. Frontend build passes.
3. Local demo mode is operational.

## Implementation Rules
1. Keep the product lean.
2. Prefer operational value over framework complexity.
3. Avoid adding vendor-specific hard dependencies unless required by a customer.
4. Track every major change here and in the changelog.
