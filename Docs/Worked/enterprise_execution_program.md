# Aurelius Enterprise Execution Program

## Date
2026-05-18

## Objective
Transform Aurelius from a basic data viewer into a decision-grade enterprise HR Intelligence platform.

## Program Structure

### Workstream A: Data Platform
1. Build ingestion adapters for HRIS and ATS.
2. Introduce Bronze/Silver/Gold data model.
3. Add data quality rules and failure alerts.
4. Definition of done:
   - Daily sync reliability >= 99%.
   - Quality checks on required fields >= 98% pass.

### Workstream B: Risk and Sentiment Models
1. Build baseline attrition model with explainability.
2. Build sentiment trend and anomaly model.
3. Add calibration and drift monitoring.
4. Definition of done:
   - Model calibration error below agreed threshold.
   - Drift alerts active in production.

### Workstream C: Talent Matching Engine
1. Implement skill ontology and graph.
2. Build role-to-profile ranking with constraints.
3. Add evidence panel for each match.
4. Definition of done:
   - Ranked match list includes explanation traces.
   - Internal mobility candidates suggested before external.

### Workstream D: Intervention and Outcomes
1. Add intervention catalog and approval workflow.
2. Add owner, due date, SLA, and status tracking.
3. Add 30/60/90-day outcome measurement.
4. Definition of done:
   - Every intervention has measurable outcome fields.
   - Team-level intervention ROI dashboard available.

### Workstream E: Executive and Governance Layer
1. Executive scenario planning and portfolio risk view.
2. Compliance and audit trail expansion.
3. Regional policy controls and access segmentation.
4. Definition of done:
   - Full audit for all recommendation-to-action transitions.
   - Regional data governance policies enforced.

## 120-Day Milestone Plan

### Milestone 1 (Day 0-30)
1. Replace placeholder dashboard with full-count analytics and risk explainers.
2. Add import quality scorecard and ingestion logs.
3. Add foundational schemas: compensation, performance, surveys, interventions.

### Milestone 2 (Day 31-60)
1. Deploy v1 attrition and sentiment models.
2. Launch team risk heatmap and intervention queue.
3. Add manager/HRBP workflow screens.

### Milestone 3 (Day 61-90)
1. Deploy talent matching v1 with skill graph.
2. Add recruiter funnel intelligence and bottleneck diagnostics.
3. Add workforce economics baseline (cost of vacancy, attrition cost).

### Milestone 4 (Day 91-120)
1. Productionize MLOps monitoring and retraining workflows.
2. Launch executive scenario lab.
3. Finalize compliance packs and enterprise controls.

## Immediate Engineering Tasks (Next Sprint)
1. Frontend:
   - Dashboard cards consume `/api/v1/ai/analytics/stream` totals.
   - Add risk-driver cards and intervention panel.
2. Backend:
   - Add new tables for interventions and outcomes.
   - Add APIs for intervention CRUD and status lifecycle.
   - Add risk explanation endpoint.
3. Data:
   - Add import validation reports and uniqueness checks.
   - Add historical snapshot ingestion for trend analytics.

## Acceptance Criteria For “Real HR Intelligence”
1. Leaders can identify top 3 risk teams with quantified impact in < 2 minutes.
2. HRBPs can execute interventions with ownership and measurable outcomes.
3. Recruiters can produce evidence-backed shortlists for each requisition.
4. Finance can simulate cost and headcount scenarios with constraints.
