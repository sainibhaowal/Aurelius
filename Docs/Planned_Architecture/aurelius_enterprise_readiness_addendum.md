   - Onboarding, data mapping, and model calibration package.

### 1.3 Procurement Readiness
1. Standard MSA + DPA templates.
2. Security questionnaire pack (SIG/CAIQ mapping).
3. SLA terms:
   - Uptime, support response, incident notification windows.

## 2. Operating Model (RACI + Governance)

### 2.1 Core Delivery Teams
1. Product and Program Management.
2. Data Engineering.
3. ML Engineering + Applied Science.
4. Backend/API Engineering.
5. Frontend/Experience Engineering.
6. Security and Compliance.
7. Customer Success and Solutions.

### 2.2 RACI Framework
1. Data contracts:
   - Responsible: Data Engineering.
   - Accountable: Data Platform Lead.
2. Model quality and fairness:
   - Responsible: ML Engineering.
   - Accountable: Head of Applied Science.
3. Policy controls and legal alignment:
   - Responsible: Security/Compliance.
   - Accountable: CISO + DPO.
4. Intervention workflow operations:
   - Responsible: Product + Backend.
   - Accountable: Product Director.

### 2.3 Release Governance
1. Environments:
   - `dev`, `stage`, `prod`, optional regulated-region prod shards.
2. Promotion gates:
   - Contract tests pass.
   - Model quality thresholds pass.
   - Security checks pass.
   - Change approval recorded.

## 3. Data Contracts and Schema Governance

### 3.1 Contract Policy
1. Every connector requires versioned schema contracts.
2. Required fields per domain:
   - employee identity, org mapping, effective dates, source metadata.
3. Contract compatibility:
   - additive changes allowed with version bump.
   - breaking changes require migration path and staging validation.

### 3.2 Freshness and Quality SLAs
1. HRIS core employee data:
   - freshness target: 24h.
2. ATS events:
   - freshness target: 1-4h.
3. Engagement and productivity metadata:
   - freshness target: daily or near-real-time per connector.
4. Quality gates:
   - null ratio, uniqueness ratio, referential integrity, type drift.
5. Quarantine policy:
   - bad payloads diverted to quarantine tables with issue taxonomy.

## 4. Security Architecture

### 4.1 Security Controls
1. Encryption:
   - at rest (database and object storage), in transit (TLS 1.2+).
2. Secrets management:
   - external KMS/secret vault references only, no plaintext secrets.
3. Tenant isolation:
   - logical isolation minimum; physical isolation option for regulated clients.
4. RBAC and ABAC:
   - role + region + data sensitivity policies.

### 4.2 Operational Security
1. Key rotation cadence and automatic credential revocation.
2. Break-glass access with dual approval and full logging.
3. Security incident response runbook and communication matrix.

## 5. Compliance and Regulatory Execution

### 5.1 Compliance Packs
1. GDPR:
   - lawful basis records, data minimization, DSAR workflows.
2. EEOC / fairness context:
   - monitored parity metrics and decision traceability.
3. Works council / regional labor governance:
   - configurable policy constraints by region.

### 5.2 Data Lifecycle Policy
1. Retention schedules by dataset domain.
2. Right-to-delete workflows with legal hold exception handling.
3. Cross-border transfer controls and residency constraints.

## 6. Model Evaluation and Experimentation

### 6.1 Evaluation Framework
1. Offline metrics:
   - PR-AUC, calibration error, stability index, drift.
2. Online metrics:
   - recommendation acceptance, intervention completion, outcome lift.

### 6.2 Experiment Design
1. Controlled rollout by business unit.
2. Quasi-experimental uplift analysis for interventions.
3. Confidence intervals and minimum detectable effect thresholds.

### 6.3 Model Risk Management
1. Model registry and lineage.
2. Champion/challenger deployment.
3. Rollback policy if fairness or calibration breaches thresholds.

## 7. Reliability, DR, and SRE Requirements

### 7.1 Reliability Targets
1. API availability SLO: 99.9% minimum.
2. Pipeline completion SLA by domain.
3. Alerting:
   - connector failures, stale data, model drift, policy engine failure.

### 7.2 Disaster Recovery
1. RTO target by tier:
   - critical APIs <= 2h.
2. RPO target:
   - core transactional and intervention tables <= 15m.
3. Backup and restore validation:
   - scheduled recovery drills.

### 7.3 Incident Operations
1. Severity framework (SEV1-SEV4).
2. On-call rotation with escalation rules.
3. Postmortem template with corrective action tracking.

## 8. Change Management and Adoption

### 8.1 Rollout Plan
1. Pilot:
   - one BU + one HRBP team.
2. Expansion:
   - cross-BU rollout with regional controls.
3. Enterprise:
   - global operating model and KPI governance board.

### 8.2 Enablement
1. Role-based training:
   - CHRO, HRBP, TA, Finance, IT/Security.
2. Playbooks:
   - interpreting risk, selecting interventions, documenting outcomes.
3. Adoption KPIs:
