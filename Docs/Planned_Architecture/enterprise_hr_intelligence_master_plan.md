# Aurelius Enterprise HR Intelligence Master Plan

## 1. Why The Current App Feels Weak
The current product mostly shows records and basic metrics. It does not yet provide:
1. Decision-grade causal insight.
2. Intervention simulation and expected impact.
3. Closed-loop outcome tracking.
4. Executive governance for confidence, bias, and ROI.

A world-class HR Intelligence system must answer:
1. What risk is rising?
2. Why is it rising?
3. What action should we take now?
4. What is expected ROI and confidence?
5. Did the action work after 30/60/90 days?

## 2. Real Use Cases By Persona

### CHRO / CEO
1. Attrition early-warning by business unit with financial impact.
2. Succession risk for critical roles.
3. Workforce cost-to-capability optimization.
4. Quarterly workforce scenario planning (growth, freeze, restructuring).

### HRBP / People Ops
1. Team-level risk diagnosis (manager change, workload, pay compression, engagement decline).
2. Recommended interventions (comp adjustment, manager coaching, role redesign, mobility path).
3. Retention outcome tracker by intervention type.

### Talent Acquisition
1. Role-to-skill graph matching across internal and external talent pools.
2. Time-to-fill and quality-of-hire optimization.
3. Funnel leak detection by stage and talent segment.

### Finance + Workforce Planning
1. Headcount forecast vs budget.
2. Hiring mix optimization (buy vs build vs borrow talent).
3. Cost-of-attrition and cost-of-vacancy dashboards.

## 3. Core Intelligence Domains (Not Placeholder Metrics)

### 3.1 Attrition Risk Intelligence
1. Models:
   - Survival analysis (Cox / Random Survival Forest) for time-to-exit.
   - Gradient boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) for 30/90/180-day risk.
2. Features:
   - Tenure, compensation percentile, promotion lag, manager tenure, mobility history, overtime proxy, sentiment trend slope, engagement survey drift, performance volatility, team churn neighborhood.
3. Outputs:
   - Individual risk probability + confidence interval.
   - Team risk heatmap.
   - Top explainers (global + local SHAP).

### 3.2 Morale / Sentiment Intelligence
1. Inputs:
   - Pulse surveys, anonymized feedback text, ticket tags, manager notes metadata.
2. Models:
   - Transformer sentiment classification + topic drift.
   - Time-series anomaly detection (STL + prophet/ARIMA).
3. Outputs:
   - Sentiment velocity and acceleration.
   - Concern themes by department.
   - Early warning thresholds with alerting.

### 3.3 Talent Matching Intelligence
1. Models:
   - Skill graph embeddings + semantic resume/job embeddings.
   - Constraint ranking (required skills, compensation band, location/legal constraints).
2. Outputs:
   - Ranked match list with evidence.
   - Skill gap report and upskilling path.
   - Internal mobility candidates before external search.

### 3.4 Workforce Economics Intelligence
1. Models:
   - Linear/integer optimization for hiring plan under budget constraints.
   - Scenario simulator for revenue plan vs headcount strategy.
2. Outputs:
   - Optimal hiring allocation by role/region/time.
   - Budget and capacity trade-off frontier.

## 4. Enterprise Architecture Upgrades

### 4.1 Data Platform
1. Bronze/Silver/Gold layers.
2. Connectors:
   - HRIS: Workday / SAP SuccessFactors / BambooHR.
   - ATS: Greenhouse / Lever.
   - Engagement: CultureAmp / Qualtrics.
   - Productivity metadata: Jira, Git, ticket systems.
3. Batch + streaming ingestion with schema contracts.

### 4.2 Model Platform (MLOps)
1. Feature store for reusable HR features.
2. Model registry + versioning.
3. Drift monitoring + fairness monitoring.
4. Champion/challenger model rollout.

### 4.3 Decision Layer
1. Policy engine for guardrails (RBAC, legal constraints, region compliance).
2. Recommendation engine with action catalog.
3. Intervention workflow engine with approvals and SLA tracking.

### 4.4 Experience Layer
1. Executive Cockpit:
   - Portfolio risk, cost impact, intervention ROI.
2. HRBP Console:
   - Team diagnosis and action planner.
3. Recruiter Console:
   - Role matching and funnel optimization.
4. Intelligence Chat:
   - Queryable evidence + traceability, never unsupported claims.

## 5. Data Model Expansion
Add new entities:
1. `compensation_history`
2. `performance_history`
3. `engagement_surveys`
4. `manager_history`
5. `interventions`
6. `intervention_outcomes`
7. `job_requisitions`
8. `candidate_pipeline_events`
9. `org_structure_snapshots`
10. `workforce_forecasts`

Each entity requires:
1. Source system metadata.
2. Effective dates (slowly changing dimensions).
3. Quality score and lineage fields.

## 6. Governance, Safety, and Compliance
1. PII minimization + tokenization.
2. Explainability required for all high-impact recommendations.
3. Human approval required for manager-impacting actions.
4. Legal policy packs by region (GDPR, works council, EEOC context).
5. Full audit trail: who saw what, who approved what, what changed.

## 7. KPI Framework (Science, Not Vanity)
Primary success metrics:
1. Preventable attrition reduction.
2. Time-to-fill reduction.
3. Quality-of-hire uplift after 90 days.
4. Manager effectiveness uplift.
5. Workforce planning forecast error reduction.
6. Financial impact: avoided attrition cost + hiring efficiency gains.

Model quality metrics:
1. AUC/PR for risk models.
2. Calibration error.
3. Drift score.
4. Fairness parity metrics.
5. Intervention causal lift confidence.
