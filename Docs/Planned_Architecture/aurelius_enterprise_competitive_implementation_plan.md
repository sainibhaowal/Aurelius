# Aurelius Enterprise Competitive Implementation Plan

## 1. Mission
Build Aurelius into an operational HR Intelligence platform that competes with SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle HCM, and Workday by delivering faster decisions, measurable outcomes, and explainable AI.

## 2. Target Market and Ideal Customers

### Primary ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
1. Mid-market and enterprise companies with 1,000-50,000 employees.
2. Multi-country organizations with high turnover pressure.
3. Companies already using HRIS + ATS + engagement tools, but lacking unified decision intelligence.

### Priority Industries
1. Technology and digital services.
2. BFSI and telecom.
3. Retail/logistics with high frontline attrition.
4. Healthcare provider networks.

### Economic Buyer and Champions
1. Economic buyer: CHRO, CFO (joint for workforce economics).
2. Champions: VP People Analytics, Head of Talent Acquisition, HRBPs.
3. Security/legal approvers: CISO, DPO, Compliance head.

## 3. Competitive Positioning

### Compete-On Dimensions
1. Decision-to-action speed:
   - From risk detection to intervention workflow in one system.
2. Explainable intelligence:
   - Risk score + top drivers + confidence + recommendation.
3. Internal mobility first:
   - Prioritize internal candidates before external cost.
4. Workforce economics:
   - Budget-constrained optimizer for hiring and retention.
5. Governance:
   - Audit trails, fairness checks, policy controls, regional compliance.

### Aurelius Wedge
Operational HR Intelligence, not dashboard analytics.

## 4. Product Pillars and Required Capabilities

### Pillar A: Risk and Retention Command Center
1. Individual and team attrition risk forecasting (30/90/180 days).
2. Risk explainability using SHAP-like factor decomposition.
3. Intervention playbooks with expected impact and cost.
4. Closed-loop outcome tracking.

### Pillar B: Talent Mobility and Hiring Intelligence
1. Role-skill graph and semantic matching.
2. Internal-first recommendation policy.
3. External candidate ranking and hiring pipeline bottleneck analysis.
4. Quality-of-hire prediction and post-hire validation.

### Pillar C: Workforce Economics and Planning
1. Hiring mix optimization under budget/headcount constraints.
2. Cost-of-attrition and cost-of-vacancy analytics.
3. Scenario simulator: growth, freeze, restructuring.
4. CFO-ready impact reports.

### Pillar D: Trust, Safety, and Compliance
1. Region-aware data controls (GDPR and local policy packs).
2. Explainability requirements for high-impact recommendations.
3. Fairness monitoring and drift alerts.
4. End-to-end auditability.

## 5. Massive Integration Architecture

### Source System Integration Scope
1. HRIS:
   - Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle HCM, BambooHR.
2. ATS:
   - Greenhouse, Lever, iCIMS.
3. Engagement:
   - CultureAmp, Qualtrics, Glint.
4. Productivity metadata:
   - Jira, ServiceNow, GitHub, Slack/Teams metadata.
5. Finance:
   - ERP/workforce budgeting sources.

### Integration Pattern
1. Connector SDK + adapter framework.
2. Batch ETL + near-real-time CDC pipelines.
3. Data contracts and schema registry.
4. Quality gates and quarantine tables for bad payloads.

### Platform Data Layers
1. Bronze: raw landed data with lineage.
2. Silver: standardized canonical HR schema.
3. Gold: model-ready and dashboard-ready marts.

## 6. Canonical Domain Model (Enterprise)
1. employee_master
2. org_hierarchy_history
3. comp_history
4. performance_history
5. engagement_events
6. manager_relationship_history
7. requisitions
8. candidate_pipeline_events
9. interventions
10. intervention_outcomes
11. workforce_budget_plan
12. forecast_scenarios

## 7. Intelligence and Algorithms

### Attrition Intelligence
1. Baseline:
   - Gradient boosting + calibration.
2. Advanced:
   - Survival analysis for time-to-exit.
3. Explainability:
   - Per-employee top contributing factors and confidence bands.

### Talent Matching Intelligence
1. Graph-based skill adjacency scoring.
2. Semantic embedding ranker for role/profile fit.
3. Constraint solver:
   - location, compensation band, legal constraints, level.

### Workforce Economics Intelligence
1. Linear/integer programming optimizer.
2. Objective functions:
   - minimize vacancy cost + attrition risk cost.
3. Constraints:
   - budget caps, hiring capacity, org targets.

## 8. Workflow Engine (Action Layer)
1. Intervention tasking:
   - owner, SLA, due date, status.
2. Approval chain:
   - HRBP -> Director -> CHRO for high-impact actions.
3. Outcome instrumentation:
   - 30/60/90-day status and effect delta.
4. Automatic follow-up triggers when no action is taken.

## 9. Product Experience Roadmap

### Console 1: Executive Cockpit
1. Enterprise risk map.
2. Financial impact tracker.
3. Scenario planner and board-ready exports.

### Console 2: HRBP Operations
1. Team diagnostic view.
2. Action queue and interventions.
3. Outcome scorecard.

### Console 3: Talent Acquisition
1. Internal mobility shortlist.
2. External pipeline intelligence.
3. Hiring quality analytics.

## 10. Phased Delivery Plan

### Phase 1 (0-90 days): Foundation and Trust
1. Build canonical model and connectors for one HRIS + one ATS.
2. Replace placeholder dashboard with total-count and driver-based insights.
3. Deliver intervention workflow MVP.
4. Deliver explainable attrition model v1.

### Phase 2 (90-180 days): Multi-domain Intelligence
1. Add engagement and productivity metadata integrations.
2. Deploy mobility and matching engine v1.
